            <p>
                I am a Salvadoran software engineer based in New York. I picked up coding as a hobby and realized how rewarding it was. 
                I decided to pursue programming as my career. I took a chance on myself and attended The Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program.
                I met incredible poeple from different backgrounds and collaborates with them on different projects, big and small. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal in every project is to make web apps that are easy to use, accessible to all, fast, responsive and dynamic. 
                My projects also center around my passion which is community, sustainability, and mental health. I hope to bring out new applications that can make a change.
                My expertise lies in front-end development but I have great experience in back-end as well. I always excited to team up and work new projects!
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, you can catch me walking my dog, petting other dogs on the street, or taking a bike ride around the park.

                Lets make something special!
